#V1.1  
1. Added support for bf2142 levels, including supplyLine and Titan mode.  
2. Fixed issues when controlpoint images overlaps with each other.(Thanks Dnamro for his experiments!)  
3. Added 'ObjectTemplate.showOnMinimap' support. ControlPoints with 'ObjectTemplate.showOnMinimap 0' do not show in the generated info image.
